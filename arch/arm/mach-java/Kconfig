	default n
	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable L2 cache prefetching
	  for the Hawaii platform. This enables both, data and
	  instruction prefetching that have been shown to improve
	  performance especially in multimedia use cases.

	  Say Y if you want to enable support for delayed PM init. Android/user
	  space can complete the PM init by writing to sysfs. Once this trigger
	  is recieved, all the PIs start changing policies, arm can enter LPM and
	  arm dfs is allowed.

       help
	Say Y if you want to enable AVS driver
	AVS driver helps pick the correct voltage table
	by identifying the silicon type thereby saving
	power by giving only reqd voltage & not excess.

	default y
	help
	 Say Y to disable A7 pll pwrdwn during frequency switching.
	 The work around is for avoiding freeze while switching from A7 PLL to
	 the 312Mhz PLL. While s/w to 312Mhz, the A7 PLL gets auto powered down,
	 before s/w process is complete, thereby resulting in a freeze.
	 WA will disable pwrdwn while switching is in progress and enable later.
	 Refer to JIRA DB for more information.

config DORMANT_MODE
	bool "Enable dormant state"
	depends on BRCM_CDC
	help
	Option to enable dormant state for cpuidle and suspend.
	Dormant mode results in PROC CCU domain voltage
	being shutoff, resulting in better power
	savings during idle.

	  During Java Bringup when we tried reboot, during the next
          boot the BootROM was detecting USB and was never timing out
          This could be because the BIT 29 of usbotgcontrol register
          was wrongly set to 1. Until we root cuase this and fix it
          We can enable this workaround only for JAVA

config USE_JAVA_SPINLOCK

	  Because of the way WFE and SEV are implemented on A7 based Java
	  there could be issues seen in the spinlocks. Enabling this option
	  would replace the WFE and SEV with NOP.
